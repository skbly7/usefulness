3. In the game specifications : \"" Fireballs can falldown from a ‘Staircase’ or ‘End of the Floor’ and will move in a particular direction, randomly chosen on a falldown. \"" is mentioned but the same has NOT been mentioned for a player so this can not be identified as a bug.

"PEP-8 Standards not followed. ex : - Leaving blank lines between functions and classes, first letter of class name should be capital, capital constant names etc.
There is no modularity.
Board Class not implemented.
Person class not implemented.
Some compulsory functions not implemented, like getPosition().
Mixed indentation.
Private variables not used.
Code smells include large class, duplicated code, excessive use of literals, cyclomatic complexity, long function.
Some features not implemented like levels, ladders, princess, only one fireball comes, coins less than 20.
Only some important collisions are checked.
The code is redundant, its mostly hard coded.
